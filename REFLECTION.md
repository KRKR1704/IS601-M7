# Reflection: Dockerizing the QR Code Generator

This was my first time trying out Docker. At the start, it felt really confusing to figure out how all the parts connected up. Still, once I watched that lecture video, things started making sense. I could follow along step by step. That really helped me get the whole idea behind containerization and its flow. For this assignment, I aimed to put the QR Code Generator into a container. I used a secure and minimal image for it. I also set up automation to build and push everything to Docker Hub with GitHub Actions. I began by putting together a Dockerfile. It was based on the python:3.12-slim-bullseye image. I made a non-root user to improve security. Plus, I set up a mounted output directory for those generated QR codes. To make the image as light as possible, I created a .dockerignore file. That excluded stuff like the generated codes that nobody needed in there. I checked too that the app handled environment variables right. It also took CLI inputs without any trouble. The main problem hit me with the GitHub Actions setup. Initially, the workflow just kept failing. I had overlooked adding the Docker Hub username and token as secret keys in the repo settings. After I fixed that and added the secrets correctly, everything ran smooth. It built the image and pushed it automatically, no issues. I ran into some smaller problems with URL validation and file permissions. I sorted those out by bringing in the validators package. I also made sure the directory ownership worked for the non-root user. In the end, I picked up a lot about why security matters in these setups. Reproducible builds are key too. And automation really ties it all together in containerized spots. Looking ahead, I want to throw in some automated tests. I figure that will make the QR code customization more flexible. I can do that with workflow parameters.
